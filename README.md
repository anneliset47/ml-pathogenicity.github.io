## Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify genetic variants as pathogenic or benign.

The goal is to build a predictive model that assists in identifying potentially harmful mutations using structured biological features.

This repository hosts the GitHub Pages deployment of the project.

---

## Problem Statement

Genetic variants can have vastly different impacts on health outcomes. Determining whether a mutation is pathogenic (disease-causing) or benign is critical for:

- Clinical diagnostics
- Risk assessment
- Personalized medicine

This project explores how supervised machine learning models can assist in this classification task.

---

## Methods

The modeling workflow includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model training and validation
- Performance evaluation using classification metrics

Algorithms explored may include:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Gradient Boosting (if applicable)

Evaluation metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC

---

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub Pages (deployment)

---

## Key Takeaways

- Feature selection significantly impacts classification performance.
- Model interpretability is critical in biomedical applications.
- Precision and recall are more meaningful than raw accuracy in imbalanced medical datasets.
